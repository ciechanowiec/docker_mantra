# Docker Cleaner Script

## Description
The script in this repository (file `.clean_docker.sh`):
1. deletes all Docker containers including volumes in use
2. deletes all Docker images

## How to Use
1. Put the script (file `.clean_docker.sh`) to the home folder so that its path will be `~/.clean_docker.sh`
2. Give the script a permission to be run (`chmod 755 ~/.clean_docker.sh`)
3. Set up the following alias for the terminal (on Linux Ubuntu aliases are usually specified in the hidden file `~/.bashrc`):</br>
`alias clean_docker='~/.clean_docker.sh'`
4. Restart all instances of the terminal 
5. Now the script can be run by invoking the `clean_docker` command
